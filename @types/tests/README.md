# @types/aframe tests

This project contains some of the tests used to validate the ambient types written for A-Frame.

## src

Contains files compiled against the aframe types. Usage in these files is a basic way to validate usage and 
 types coincide.

## tests

Contains unit tests that are built against the A-Frame types and validate on-going expectations of the structure
 of the A-Frame framework. If structure change then these tests should notify us to those changes.
